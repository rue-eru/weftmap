Weftmap turns source code into a navigable diagram of which functions call
which. The differentiator is a **pluggable, multi-language architecture**: the
backend adapts the analysis per language, and adding a new one takes only a few
lines. No existing free tool does this well across several languages at once.

> **Status:** MVP. Supports **Python**, **JavaScript/TypeScript**, **Go**, **Rust** and **SQL**.
> Diagram types: call graph (functions as nodes, calls as arrows) and, for SQL,
> entity-relationship (tables as nodes, foreign keys as edges).

## Features

- **Multi-language** — one parsing engine (Tree-sitter) for every language.
- **Pluggable** — a language is a single `LangSpec` + two Tree-sitter queries.
- **Interactive diagram** — pan, zoom and drag nodes (React Flow + dagre layout).
- **Internal call graph** — shows calls between functions defined in your code;
  calls to builtins/libraries are filtered out to keep the graph meaningful.
- **No build step for the user** — paste a snippet and hit _Analyze_.

## How it works

```
┌──────────┐   POST /api/analyze   ┌─────────────────────┐   Graph JSON   ┌─────────────┐
│  Browser │ ────────────────────▶ │  Tree-sitter (WASM) │ ─────────────▶ │  React Flow │
│ (textarea)│   { code, language }  │  per-language module │  {nodes,edges} │  (dagre)    │
└──────────┘                       └─────────────────────┘                └─────────────┘
```

1. You paste code and pick a language.
2. The backend (`src/app/api/analyze/route.ts`) validates the input, parses the
   code with the matching Tree-sitter grammar, and walks the syntax tree to build
   a normalized graph `{ nodes, edges }`.
3. The frontend lays it out with [dagre](https://github.com/dagrejs/dagre) and
   renders it interactively with [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/).

The call graph is extracted with **declarative Tree-sitter queries** (one for
function definitions, one for calls) instead of hand-walking the AST — less code,
easier to maintain, and the same approach works for every language.

## Getting started

**Requirements:** Node 20+ and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/).

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pnpm install

# 2. Start the dev server
pnpm dev
# open http://localhost:3000
```

Paste a snippet, choose **python** or **javascript**, and click **Analyze**.

## Available scripts

| Command          | What it does                    |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `pnpm dev`       | Start the development server    |
| `pnpm build`     | Production build                |
| `pnpm start`     | Run the production build        |
| `pnpm test`      | Run the analyzer tests (Vitest) |
| `pnpm typecheck` | Type-check with `tsc --noEmit`  |
| `pnpm lint`      | Lint with ESLint                |

## Adding a language

This is the most valuable kind of contribution. The architecture is _pluggable_:
the backend adapts the analysis per language, and nothing else needs to change.

1. **Add the grammar.** Copy `tree-sitter-<lang>.wasm` into `public/wasm/`
   (available from the [`tree-sitter-wasms`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tree-sitter-wasms)
   package).
2. **Create the analyzer.** Add `src/lib/analysis/analyzers/<lang>.ts` with a
   `LangSpec` — two Tree-sitter queries (function definitions and calls) plus the
   set of node types that count as a function scope. Use
   [`python.ts`](src/lib/analysis/analyzers/python.ts) as a template.
3. **Register it.** Add one line to
   [`src/lib/analysis/registry.ts`](src/lib/analysis/registry.ts).
4. **Add the UI option.** Add the language key to the `LANGUAGES` array in
   [`src/app/page.tsx`](src/app/page.tsx).
5. **Add a test.** Drop a snippet → expected nodes/edges check in
   `src/lib/analysis/analyzers/`.

That's it.
